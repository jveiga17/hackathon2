a web application for generating playlists according to the mood the user sets

The back end of the project shows great understanding of R.E.S.T ! 
Creating endpoints on the server , making routes, controllers and models that communicate with the database.
On the front end I love that there are comments which make it easy to understand the code.
Good error handeling.
A video was not provided so unfortunatly I couldn't see the project in action.
Really nice job!
